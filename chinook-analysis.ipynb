    "To investigate potential reasons behind this performance gap, we analyzed:\n",
    "- **Years of Employment**: There’s no consistent pattern between tenure and sales performance. For example, Park and Peacock both have similar years of experience, yet Peacock leads in revenue.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Job Titles**: Only the three sales-performing employees have the title “Sales Support Agent”, suggesting the others likely serve in non-sales roles (e.g., IT staff or management).  \n",

    "The differences in performance are not due to behavioral reasons. Only three employees are assigned customer-facing sales duties.  \n",

    "Out of all invoices in the dataset, only a small subset (171 invoices) contain tracks from a single album. Within this filtered group:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- 114 invoices (67%) represent full album purchases (i.e., the invoice contains all tracks from a single album).\n",
    "- 57 invoices (33%) represent partial purchases, where the customer selected only some tracks from the album.  \n",

    "  \n",
    "When considering all invoices in the database, this translates to:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- 18.57% of total invoices are full album purchases.\n",
    "- 9.28% are partial album purchases from a single album.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results suggest that while full album purchases do occur with some regularity, a meaningful portion of customers still prefer to buy individual tracks, even when they’re purchasing from just one album. This supports management’s idea to move toward selling popular tracks only, as long as the store continues to accommodate full-album buyers.\n"
